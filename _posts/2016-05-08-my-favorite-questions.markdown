# My Favorite Interview Questions!  

#### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself learning something new, taking on a lot of challenges and wanting to take on 
more.  With the right resources I will become a stronger developer and systems administrator.

#### Can you tell me about yourself?

I moved to Portland, OR in 2003 to find a career based around my degree in Electronics Technology 
Engineering.   I landed work in the Semi Conductor field and was on my way!  But quickly I was asked to help out in IT.
Wanting to be a team player I decided to give it a try, before I knew it I was hooked!  I started off in Help Desk, quickly 
become a developer and within a few years I was an IT Manager.
