# My Favorite Interview Questions!  

#### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself sitting on a beach feeling the cool air on my face ;)

Back to reality... I see myself have learning something new, have taken on a lot of challenges and waiting to take on 
more.  With the right resources I most likely have become a stronger developer and a wicked 
automator.  In addition I have learned new technologies that were never thought of before but have become indispensable
 to technology; maybe a new language, framework or service.  Docker, Puppet or Spring Framework to name a few.s

#### Can you tell me about yourself?
