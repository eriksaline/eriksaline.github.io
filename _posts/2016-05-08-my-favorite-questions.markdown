# My Favorite Interview Questions!  

#### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself sitting on a beach feeling the cool air on my face ;)

Back to reality... I see myself have learning something new, have taken on a lot of challenges and waiting to take on 
more.  With the right resources I most likely have become a stronger developer and a wicked 
automator.  In addition I have learned new technologies that were never thought of before but have become indispensable
 to technology; maybe a new language, framework or service.  Docker, Puppet or Spring Framework to name a few.

#### Can you tell me about yourself?

I sure can...I moved to Portland, OR in 2003 to find a career based around my degree in Electronics Technology 
Engineering.   I landed work in the Semi Conductor field and was on my way!  But quickly I was asked to help out in IT.
Wanting to be a team player I decided to give it a try, before I knew it I was hooked!  I started off in Help Desk and 
within a few years I was the IT Manager.  IT and computers comes naturally to me and was amazed I what I learned.  

*  Apple makes great easy to use products, sometimes too many options is not always a good thing
*  Set up any company with a network that can be securely accessed from any where
*  Set up servers and services to track projects, create and display key reports and automate key tasks 
*  Never reinvent the wheel when it comes to computers, let others iron out the mistakes
*  There is no down side to testing too much
*  Either Agile, Waterfall, ISO or 5S learn a process and apply it
