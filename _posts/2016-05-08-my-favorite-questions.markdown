I moved to Portland, OR in 2003 to find a career based around my degree in Electronics Technology 
Engineering.   I landed work in the Semi Conductor field and was on my way!  But quickly I was asked to help out in IT.
Wanting to be a team player I decided to give it a try, before I knew it I was hooked!  I started off in Help Desk, quickly 
become a developer and within a few years I was an IT Manager.
