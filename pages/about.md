Big companies rely on computers, so much that down-time can cost companies millions of dollars.  If your company cannot afford IT down-time than my experience can provide optimal IT performance.  I have worked as a Systems Engineer, Software Engineer and Project Manager in a variety of technology based industries.  

Including experience, planning is key part to any successful team.  13 years of Atlassian experience has allowed me to quickly and easily solve any IT problem with a great plan.  

17 years experience in enterprise application, database, automation and report design using a wide variety of computer languages, frameworks, software development kits, close/open source tools and methodologies.
